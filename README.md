# Advanced Automation & Data Visualization Showcase

This repository contains **three professional, Python-based projects** that showcase advanced automation, cloud/virtualization orchestration concepts, and data visualization techniques. Each project is self-contained with realistic, mocked sample data so you can run and review the code locally without external cloud credentials.

Projects:
1. `aws-tag-compliance-automator/` — Simulated AWS resource discovery, tag-compliance enforcement planner, automated remediation playbooks, and visual dashboards.
2. `vmware-inventory-reporter/` — VMware inventory analyzer and automation simulator that detects risks (orphaned disks, snapshots, power-state drift) and creates executive and technical reports.
3. `dataops-pipeline-visualizer/` — End-to-end mock ETL pipeline demonstrating data engineering automation, quality checks, and interactive visualizations for analytics stakeholders.

Each project contains:
- production-quality Python scripts (modular, documented)
- `requirements.txt` for installing dependencies
- `sample_data/` with realistic mocked data
- `README.md` per project with usage, architecture, and employer-focused talking points

These projects are designed to be interview- and employer-friendly: they show architecture, automation, error-handling, logging, reproducible outputs, and polished visual artifacts (PNG/HTML) you can present.
