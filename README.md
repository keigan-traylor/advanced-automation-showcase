# Advanced Automation & Data Visualization Showcase

This repository contains **three professional, high-level Python-based projects** that showcase automation, cloud/virtualization orchestration concepts, and data visualization techniques. Each project is self-contained with realistic, sample data so you can run and review the code locally without needing credentials.

**Projects:**
1. `aws-tag-compliance-automator/` — Simulated AWS resource discovery, tag-compliance enforcement planner, automated remediation playbooks, and visual dashboards.
2. `vmware-inventory-reporter/` — VMware inventory analyzer and automation simulator that detects risks and creates executive and technical reports.
3. `dataops-pipeline-visualizer/` — Sample ETL pipeline demonstrating data engineering automation, quality checks, and interactive visualizations for analytics.

Each project contains:
- production-quality Mock Python scripts **intentionally high-level**
- `requirements.txt` for installing dependencies
- `sample_data/` 
- `README.md` per project with usage instructions 

These projects are designed to demonstrate a high-level technical understanding of relevant topics. They show architecture, automation, error-handling, logging, reproducible outputs, and polished visual artifacts (PNG/HTML) you can present.
